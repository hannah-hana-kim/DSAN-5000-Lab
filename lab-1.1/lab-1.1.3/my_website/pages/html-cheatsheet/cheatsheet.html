		<p>Ingredients</p>
		<ul> 
		  <li>Butter</li>
		  <li>Eggs</li>
		  <li>Sugar</li>
		  <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
		  <li>Baking Soda</li>
		  <li>Water</li>
		  <li>Salt</li>
		  <li>Flour</li>
		  <li>Chocolate Chips</li>
		  <li>Nuts (optional)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Easy Recipe</p>
		<p id="cookie_recipe">You’re going to start by melting the <span class="ingredients" style="color: chocolate">butter</span>. The butter shouldn’t be sizzling hot. If it is about 90% melted, and then you’ll whisk it until it finishes melting.<br>
			Once the butter has melted, whisk in the <span class="ingredients" style="color: chocolate">sugar</span> until well-combined. Mix in the <span class="ingredients" style="color: chocolate">vanilla extract</span> and <span class="ingredients" style="color: chocolate">egg</span>.<br>
			Add the <span class="ingredients" style="color: chocolate">flour</span>, <span class="ingredients" style="color: chocolate">baking soda</span>, and <span class="ingredients" style="color: chocolate">salt</span>. Stir in just until combined. Stir in the <span class="ingredients" style="color: chocolate">chocolate chips</span>, and then scoop the <span class="ingredients" style="color: chocolate">dough</span>. <br>
			Place about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the cookies are set on the edges but slightly underdone in the middle, about 7-10 minutes. <br>
			Slightly under-baking the cookies helps to keep them soft. Since oven temperatures can vary, you may find that you need to adjust the baking times.
